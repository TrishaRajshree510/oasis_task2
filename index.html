        <div class="right-box"style="float:right;"><h6 id="name">VINEETA SINGH</h6><br> <p>Vineeta Singh is an Indian entrepreneur and CEO of Sugar Cosmetics. She has been a shark (i.e. judge/investor) on the business reality TV show Shark Tank India since the show started airing on SonyLIV in 2021.Singh was born in 1983 in Anand, Gujarat.[1] Her mother holds a PhD and her father Tej P. Singh is a biophysicist at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences.[2]

            Singh completed her school education at Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram in 2001.Singh completed her electrical engineering studies at IIT-M and earned the bachelor's degree in 2005.[5] Afterward, she obtained an MBA from Indian Institute of Management (Ahmedabad) in 2007.[6] During her MBA studies, in 2006, she worked as a summer intern at Deutsche Bank and rejected a job from that company despite an annual Rs 1 crore salary.[7][8] Singh and the other graduate who rejected the same offer wanted to instead start their own lingerie business, based on their own research.[9] However, unable to raise the required funding, the aspiration to start a consumer brand for women did not take off.</p>
        <p>In 2007, Singh founded her first start-up Quetzal.[10] However, the idea of providing background verification checks to recruiters failed to succeed in this very cost-driven market. She started her second start-up Fab-Bag in 2012, a subscription platform that provided monthly deliveries of beauty products.[11] Her third start-up, Sugar Cosmetics, Singh founded together with her husband in 2015.[12] The company sells cosmetics and personal care products geared towards the Indian market.[13] In a BBC interview, Singh recounts that her hiring strategy is closely related to marketing, as many young Indian women in her work force create a company culture close to the target consumers.[14] After closing a $50 million seal with private equity firm L Catterton, Singh characterized the company's products as catering to the preferences of women with diverse skin tones.[15] In September 2022, Bollywood star Ranveer Singh invested an undisclosed amount and became a "brand evangelist" of Sugar Cosmetics.[16][17]

            Singh appeared on the hard copy cover pages of business magazines, such as Forbes India, Business Today, and Businessworld.[18][19][20] In the associated cover story, Singh tells Forbes about her journey as a female entrepreneur, from failures to exponential economic growth.[21] To Business Today, she revealed that funding was once only granted under the condition that her husband joined the company full-time, which she viewed as gender discrimination.[22] With Businessworld, she shared her vision to change the narrative of the Indian female workforce and "inspire young girls to dream big".[23]
            
            In 2021, Forbes India listed Singh as one of its Forbes India W-Power list of women achievers</p></div>
